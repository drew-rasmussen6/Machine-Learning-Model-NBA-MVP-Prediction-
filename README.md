NBA MVP Prediction Model
Project Overview
This project develops a machine learning model to predict the winner of the National Basketball Association's (NBA) Most Valuable Player (MVP) award. The MVP award is the NBA's highest individual honor, presented annually to the player deemed most valuable to their team during the regular season. Voted on by a panel of sportswriters and broadcasters throughout the United States and Canada, the award represents recognition of exceptional performance, leadership, and contribution to team success.
By analyzing historical player statistics and team performance metrics, this model identifies patterns in MVP voting behavior and generates predictions for future award winners.
Why Predict NBA MVP?
Predicting the NBA MVP has several practical applications:
* Sports Analytics: Provides insights into which statistics and factors voters value most, revealing evolving trends in how basketball excellence is measured
* Sports Betting: Offers valuable information for those participating in MVP betting markets
* Fantasy Basketball: Helps fantasy players identify high-value players for their teams
* Basketball Operations: Assists NBA front offices in evaluating player impact and value
* Media Coverage: Enables more informed discussion of player performance and award races
Features
* Multiple predictive models including Linear Regression, LASSO, Ridge, Elastic Net, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors
* Feature engineering to create composite metrics that better capture player value
* Cross-validation for reliable model evaluation
* Interactive visualizations of model performance and predictions
* MVP winner prediction with 50% accuracy on test data
Technical Approach
The project follows a systematic machine learning workflow:
1. Data Preparation
o Loading and cleaning NBA player statistics data
o Handling missing values
o Creating an MVP winner indicator
o Feature engineering to capture player performance holistically
o Standardizing numeric features
o Creating time-based features to capture performance trends
2. Feature Selection
o Correlation analysis to identify variables most strongly associated with MVP voting
o Selection of top 10 features for model building
3. Model Building
o Training multiple regression and machine learning models
o 5-fold cross-validation to ensure model reliability
o Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance
4. Model Evaluation
o Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) calculation for each model
o Identification of the best-performing model
o MVP prediction accuracy assessment
o Feature importance analysis
5. Visualization
o Model performance comparison
o Feature importance visualization
o Actual vs. predicted award shares
o Top predicted MVP candidates
Key Findings
* The best performing model achieved an RMSE of approximately 0.492
* The model correctly identified the MVP winner in 50% of test seasons
* Key predictive features include advanced metrics like Win Shares (WS), Box Plus/Minus (BPM), and Value Over Replacement Player (VORP), along with composite metrics like team success and two-way player score
* Team success plays a significant role in MVP selection, confirming the conventional wisdom that the best player on one of the best teams often wins the award
Historical Context
The NBA MVP award has been presented since the 1955-56 season. Notable trends in MVP selection include:
* Only three players have won the award on teams with losing records
* The award tends to favor players on top-seeded playoff teams
* Centers dominated early MVP awards, while guards and forwards have become more prevalent winners in recent decades
* Offensive production has historically been weighted more heavily than defensive contributions
Dependencies

Future Work
1. Collect more recent data to validate the model on the latest seasons
2. Explore additional features such as media attention metrics and narrative factors
3. Develop an ensemble approach combining multiple top-performing models
4. Create an interactive prediction tool for upcoming seasons
5. Incorporate in-season updates to provide real-time MVP race tracking
